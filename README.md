**Assignments** is an application that allows teachers to create assignments for
studies.

The project was built using **Java**, **Java Swing** and **SQL**.

> [!NOTE]
This application was developed during my time as a student, under a tight
deadline and while managing other projects. It offers the core functionality,
but you may encounter bugs, rough edges, and code thatâ€™s not production-ready.
